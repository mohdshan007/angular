In typical construction and painting projects, the amount of paint or primer in a bucket is measured in liters. Here's a detailed description:
1. Paint and Primer Bucket Sizes
•	Standard Size: The most common size for a bucket of paint or primer is 5 liters.
•	Coverage: One 5-liter bucket of paint or primer typically covers around 50-60 square meters per coat, depending on the surface texture and application method.
2. Primer
•	Purpose: Primer is a preparatory coating applied before painting. It helps seal the surface, provides a uniform base for paint, and enhances paint adhesion.
•	Quantity Calculation:
o	Room Size: 6m x 6m room (36 square meters).
o	Wall Area: For a standard room with a height of 3 meters:
Total Wall Area=Perimeter×Height=(6m+6m+6m+6m)×3m=72 square meters\text{Total Wall Area} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Height} = (6m + 6m + 6m + 6m) \times 3m = 72 \text{ square meters}Total Wall Area=Perimeter×Height=(6m+6m+6m+6m)×3m=72 square meters
o	Ceiling Area:
6m×6m=36 square meters6m \times 6m = 36 \text{ square meters}6m×6m=36 square meters
o	Total Area to Prime:
72 square meters (walls)+36 square meters (ceiling)=108 square meters72 \text{ square meters (walls)} + 36 \text{ square meters (ceiling)} = 108 \text{ square meters}72 square meters (walls)+36 square meters (ceiling)=108 square meters
•	Primer Needed:
o	For one coat, a 5-liter bucket covers about 50-60 square meters.
o	For 108 square meters, you would need approximately 2 buckets of primer to apply a single coat over the entire area.
3. Paint
•	Purpose: Paint is applied over the primer to give the walls and ceiling their final color and finish.
•	Quantity Calculation:
o	Same Coverage: Paint typically covers the same area as primer.
o	For 108 square meters, you would need 2 buckets of paint for a single coat.
Recap:
•	Primer: 2 buckets (5 liters each) for 108 square meters.
•	Paint: 2 buckets (5 liters each) for 108 square meters.
If applying two coats (which is common), you'd double the number of buckets for both primer and paint.
